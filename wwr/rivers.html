        <h2>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h2>
        <p>
            Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river. The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people living near it because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left.
            Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer.

            Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the Green river flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous.
            Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days
            Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark.  This designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.
